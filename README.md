# Menard

> Pierre Menard, author of the Quixote: rewrite a text word for word and have it come out

AST-aware editing for Elixir. Every verb parses the file, changes the tree, and parse-checks what
it writes — so a half-applied edit is impossible, and only the bytes a verb names move
(Sourceror patches, not a reformat of the whole file).

It runs as a project of its own, which means `menard` keeps working on a codebase that does not
currently compile — the case where you most need it.

## Install

Two things ship, and they install differently.

**The library** — `Menard.Rename`, `Menard.Outline`, `Menard.Clause` and the rest as plain
functions, for a tool of your own:

```elixir
{:menard, "~> 0.1"}
```

**The verbs** — the CLI, the MCP door and the Claude Code hooks — run from *this* project, with
its own deps, which is what lets them work on a codebase that does not compile. So they install
from git, not from hex:

```
/plugin marketplace add lessthanseventy/menard
/plugin install menard@menard
```

Or clone it and put `bin/menard` on your `PATH`. Either way the first invocation fetches and
compiles its deps for you.

## Verbs

```
outline FILE                                   what is in the file
find PATTERN FILES                             where a thing is
deps FILE name/arity                           what a function calls

mcp                                            the same verbs over MCP
```

`--frozen` runs the last build straight off `_build` with no compile step: the escape hatch for
editing menard *with* menard, where a half-applied edit would otherwise lock the tool out of
finishing its own change.

## Claude Code plugin

`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `hooks/hooks.json` make this directory a plugin. Two hooks:

- **`menard-only.sh`** (`PreToolUse`) blocks `Edit`/`Write` on any `.ex`/`.exs` holding a
  `defmodule`. It passes new files, `_build/`, `deps/`, `config/*.exs` and `.formatter.exs` —
  menard has no verbs for a bare keyword list, so those are edited directly. It does not watch
  `Bash`: a shell command has no structured target, and matching the command text blocks anything
  that merely quotes the pattern. Precision over coverage — a guard that fires on innocent
  commands gets switched off.
- **`format-elixir.sh`** (`PostToolUse`) formats whatever was written with the file's *own*
  project formatter, plugins included, so the formatter's output is what the next read shows.
- **`prefer-menard-run.sh`** (`PostToolUse`) points a bare `mix test`/`compile`/`format` at
  `menard run`, which answers in one structured line. Advisory — the command has already run, and
  that is what lets the match stay loose.

The guard exists because the rule "use menard for Elixir" was written down and then broken inside
the hour. A rule an agent has to remember is a rule it breaks.
