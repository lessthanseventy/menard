# PreToolUse hook: an Elixir module is edited with menard's verbs, not with Edit/Write or a
# sed/python one-liner. The verbs parse the file, change the tree and parse-check the result, so a
# half-applied edit is impossible; a text substitution is a guess that is right most of the time,
# and the times it is wrong are silent.
#
# A rule the agent has to remember is a rule it breaks, which is the argument for a hook rather
# than a note in AGENTS.md. Blocks (exit 2) and names the verb to use instead.
#
# Scope, deliberately narrow so it never blocks legitimate work:
#   - only .ex/.exs files that actually hold a `defmodule` (menard's domain)
#   - never new files, _build/, deps/, or the bare-data .exs (config/, .formatter.exs, mix.lock)
#
# Edit/Write only, NOT Bash. A shell command carries no structured target, so deciding whether it
# writes to an Elixir file means pattern-matching the command text — and that fires on a command
# that merely QUOTES the pattern (a test, a grep for `sed -i`, a heredoc showing the wrong way).
# A guard that blocks innocent commands is worse than no guard. `sed -i` on a module is still
# wrong; it is AGENTS.md's job to say so, not this hook's job to guess.

Blocked: $1

An Elixir module is edited with menard's verbs — they parse the file, change the tree and
parse-check what they write — not with text substitution:

  $m outline FILE                        what is in the file
  $m attr get|set|delete FILE NAME [VAL]  a module attribute
  $m clause replace|rewrite|delete|insert-after FILE name/arity HEAD [CODE]
  $m stmt insert-after|replace|delete FILE name/arity HEAD MATCH [CODE]
  $m block get|replace|add FILE NAME [CODE]
  $m rename OLD NEW [--atoms] [--comments] FILES

If this file genuinely is not a module (a plain script, a data .exs), say so and edit it
directly — do not reach for a different write idiom to get around this.
